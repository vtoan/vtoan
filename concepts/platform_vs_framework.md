# Platform vs Framework
---
### Platform
Provides **hardware and/or software (as Operating System...) tools** needs to run an application. (A platform is *host* to an app) *Ex: IOS, Android, Window, MasOS...*

Platforms provide developers with one **environment** that contains all of tools that they need to **create and run** a application.

Platform provides typically offer one or more **Software Development Kits (SKDs)** for developers. An **SDKs** is only a tool to write an application. (*SDKs usually consist of a set of classes, utilities for debugging and sample code to make building a platform application easier.*)

### Framework

A Framework (Development Framework) helps **facilitate software development** by **providing generic capabilities** that **can be changed or configured** to create a specific software application.

Development Frameworks can be likened to **code libraries** with included **application's architecture** and **structure design skeleton** for use in development an application quickly.

### Libraries 
Libraries are **sets of code that can be reused** in development work.

### Environments

Environment refers to **generic configuration of hardware and system** of a platform (IOS, Android, Window...) or computer which application is **deployed and executed.**

*Ex: networking environment, database environment, transaction processing environment, batch environment, interactive environment...* 

Environment types in industrial use:
- Development
- Staging/UAT
- Production/Live

A programming environment would include **the compiler and associated development tools**.
