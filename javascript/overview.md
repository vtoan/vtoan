## 2. 'This' in Javascript

The `this` keyword refers to an object. The value of this inside a function depends upon how that function is invoked. (refers to  Global or Owner object).

- Default binding.
- Implicit binding. (when using callback, function expression...)
- Explicit binding. (using `call()`, `apply()`, `bind()` function)
